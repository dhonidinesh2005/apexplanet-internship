    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <hr />
    <br/>
    <p class="about">I’m Dhoni Dinesh, a Web Developer & Software Engineer with a passion for building clean, efficient, and user-friendly digital experiences. I love turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions through code.

        I work across the full stack, with hands-on experience in technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Python. From developing responsive websites to designing powerful backend systems, I enjoy creating software that’s not just functional, but meaningful.
        
        When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me on the badminton court, hanging out with friends, or enjoying some well-deserved downtime. I'm also deeply connected to my family, whose strong support and love keep me grounded and motivated every step of the way.
        
        I’m always exploring new tools, frameworks, and ideas—because growth never stops in tech. If you’re looking to collaborate, build something cool, or just say hi, feel free to reach out!</p>
        <h2>Outside of Code</h2>
        <p class="outside">
    While I love crafting digital experiences, life isn’t all about the keyboard. In my free time, you’ll often find me playing badminton—it’s my go-to way to stay active, focused, and refreshed. I also really enjoy chilling with friends, whether it’s over coffee, gaming sessions, or just sharing some laughs and good vibes. These moments help me recharge and bring fresh creativity into my work.
    
    But what truly keeps me grounded is my family. I share a strong, unshakable bond with them—they’re my biggest cheerleaders, my source of strength, and the reason I push myself to be better every day. Their love and support are at the heart of everything I do, both personally and professionally.
